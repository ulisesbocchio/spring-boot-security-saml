## Work In Progress

This project targets a smooth integration between spring-security-saml and Spring Boot by exposing a set of configurer adapters while dealing with the nitty-gritty and verbosity of spring-security-saml configuration internally.

## Check out the spring-security-saml Sample

In [spring-boot-security-saml-sample](spring-boot-security-saml-sample) there's a fully working Spring Boot app integrated with Spring Security SAML and several IdPs (SSOCircle, Ping Identity, OKTA, OpenLogin)
